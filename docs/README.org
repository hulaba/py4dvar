** A Word on Naming Conventions
CamelCase is used where possible for multiword names. FFDAS needs to
be able to import a module given the name of a class instantiated in
it. (See [[file:sector/__init__.py][sector package initialisation]] for an example). We also want
to follow the python convention of classes being capitalised but
modules not.
Thus, at least for sectors and observables   class MySector must be defined in module mySector.py.
** Notes
Uses python 3 formatting, should run under 2.7
