How to use the logging feature:
- check/modify the display settings in 'root/setup_logging.py'
- within module of interest ensure near the top of the file are the lines
  > import setup_logging
  > logger = setup_logging.get_logger( __file__ )
- use the logger to print as desired eg:
  > logger.debug( 'var x == 1.0' )
  > logger.error( 'unable to open file a.txt' )
