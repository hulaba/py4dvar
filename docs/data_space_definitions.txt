Spaces definitions

Every 'space' data occupies as it is transformed through the model is defined as a python class.

These space are:

PhysicalData:
-representation of the dataset you are trying to optimize for.
-is constructed as the background / prior estimate for the minimizer and from the UnknownData
-is converted into UnknownData and ModelInputData
(e.g: model parameters)

UnknownData:
-the vector form of PhysicalData
-is already pre-conditioned (if applicable)
-is run through the minimizer
-is constructed from and converted into PhysicalData

ModelInputData:
-the required input for the forward model to run
-is constructed from PhysicalData and converted into ModelOutputData
(e.g: a list of filenames used by the forward model)

ModelOutputData:
-the output of the forward model
-is constructed from ModelInputData and converted into ObservationData

ObservationData:
-the set of observations either from measurements or simulated from the model
-is constructed from ModelOutputData (observation operator) and as the observed data (from file)
-is converted into residuals (also ObservationData) and AdjointForcingData

AdjointForcingData:
-the input of the adjoint model
-is constructed from the weighted residuals of ObservationData
-is converted into SensitivityData

SensitivityData:
-the output of the adjoint model
-is constructed from AdjointForcingData
-is converted into PhysicalAdjointData

PhysicalAdjointData:
-the sensitivity from the adjoint model in PhysicalData units
-shares almost all properties with PhysicalData
-is contructed from SensitivityData
-is converted into UnknownData (as a gradient)
